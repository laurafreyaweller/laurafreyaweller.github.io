The molds I made by using waste materials at de Waag. De Waag used for Museumnacht big cardboard signs. I decided to add a layer of epoxy to them, tape the sides with universal painters tape and 3D print little adjustable legs to put on the bottom of the mold to make sure the mold would be level. Below you can see the process of that. 

First I printed these little adjustable legs. I got them from https://grabcad.com/library/adjustable-gpu-support-column-1

Then I ordered the epoxy and the tape:

Then I varnished the paper with epoxy, let that dry and added the tape around. This created a mold that is level and can be used for biomaterials.
