While having made the digital looks, I started on the physical ones. I had to make the first and second look physically as well. First I created the patterns and lasercutted them. After that I used the leather machine at AMFI to sew the first look (the denim suit) and the leather machine at the house of arts and crafts. This place has good contacts with De Waag. I thought it would be a great idea to use the leather machines there: this way they could learn about the biomaterials, I could broaden my contacts and the students at AMFI had more space to use the leather machines (cause they were already quite busy). 
After sewing the garments together I sew all the loose threads back invisible inside the seams of the garment. This gave the garment a much more finished look already. Below you can see some images of my process.
