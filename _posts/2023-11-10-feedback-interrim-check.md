In week 14 I had the concept check of my project. Here I tried to showcase my project by presenting the "what, why, how" of my project. Whereas last time I tried to dive deeper in the "Why" of my project, this time I tried to push the "How" more forward. Below you can see my presentation:

The feedback I got on this presentation was as follows:
Overall Feedback Interim Check Project definition, final graduation plan & realisation plan
- You made good new steps. We see that you have worked on the biodegradable materials and dived deeper in the archetypical garments. Keep up the good work.
