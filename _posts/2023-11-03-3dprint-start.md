When starting with the 3D printing I made 2 pastes that I could work with:
1. Based on Sodium Alginate & paper
2. Based on MCC & paper

The outcome of both prints made me realize that I had to make sure that 
- The printing paste would be thick but very smooth
- the nossil should be small
- I should print under infra-red lighting
- I should print with a hot air fan next to it
- I should print on a surface that holds the paste well: plaster/cast

Here you can see the first print + result:

The result of the 3D print is:

After ordering the infra red lighting and the hot air fan, I will try to print again.
