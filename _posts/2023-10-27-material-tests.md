For the testing of the chosen materials I decided to test some materials and already rejected some other materials. Below you see the result of each material and whether I rejected it beforehand or not:

After rejecting some materials and accepting others, I decided to test the materials on 4 things:
1. [strongness] (strongness)
2. [water-resistance] (water-resistance)
3. [compostability] (compostability)
4. [sizing] (sizing)

When you click on the options, you see the methods + outcome of each test.
