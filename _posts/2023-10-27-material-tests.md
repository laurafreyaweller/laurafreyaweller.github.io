For the testing of the chosen materials I decided to test some materials, but not all. Depending on the outcome of the first try I already foresaw that some materials did not work on bigger scale. After rejecting those materials and accepting the others, I decided to test the materials on 4 things:
1. [strongness](strongness)
2. [water-resistance](water-resistance)
3. [compostability](compostability)
4. [sizing](sizing)

When you click on the options, you see the methods + outcome of each test. 

Below you can see which materials are rejected and which not after testing them on the variables above.
