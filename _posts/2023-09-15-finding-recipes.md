To find recipes I have looked at many different websites. Some of them you can find here below:

After researching various websites I decided to add a few properties to my materials:
1. You need to be able to sew it
2. It needs to be biodegradable
3. It needs to fit the needs of the rebels

In order to make these three things compatible, I had to research further. To make a biodegradable garment that can be sewn, I had to look into strong biomaterials and biodegradable yarn. The yarn I found through unbleached linnen yarn (see image below)

After finding the yarn, I went on looking for strong materials. I came upon a recipe from another fablab; the one in Barcelona. Their recipe made a garment with wool. I know that in the Netherlands, there are a lot of sheep of which their wool is not used. Therefore I bought wool from a farmer in Drente (see image below)

After buying the wool and the linnen yarn, I created an overview of the recipes that I would test. I use 2 bases: Sodium Alginate and CMC+DMC. I combine these bases with paper, orange peel, wool or coffee (or a combination of). Then I test the fabric properties and then I see what I take with me to the next step.
