After I decided to visualize my concept through a vogue magazine, I decided to start working final texturizing of my looks so I can really start testing out my renders. Below you can see some of that process per look.

1. The suit
For texturing the suit I worked from CLO to Substance Painter to Blender. In substance painter I added a height map to give the topstitches some extra height and accent. Furthermore I added an extra normal map to give the biomaterial more texture. This I did by using an already existing normal map from [here](https://3dtextures.me/2019/03/11/abstract-organic-002/). This map is created for abstract organic shapes and it worked well to give the material some extra waviness. I also added a loose structured wool as a normal map to the suit to give it more roughness. Then on top of that I added 2 extra roughness layers to give the material an extra rough texture.

2. Red rebel look
For texturing the rebel look I worked again from CLO to Substance to Blender. While creating the suit look, I added a lot of details. These details I saved as a smart material, so I could upload them immediately in the rebel look. However, this gave a very mettalic flashy effect so I had to change some values. On top of that I added a dusty layer to take away the metallic effect. This gives the look a more natural wool fibred look.

3. Banner
For texturing the banner look I kept working from CLO to Substance to Blender. I added details from the smart materials that I created before, but I also added the texture from the print. This texture I downloaded [here](https://3dtextures.me/2019/10/25/metal-painted-001a/). After using this texture as a print, I also edited that in substance.

4. Collective garment
For texturing the collective garment I first created a seated pose for the avatar. I made 2 models that I could connect to one another. Both models wear identical outfits, but the patterns are a bit different as one model is a woman, and one is a man. After assigning both models their looks and their materials that come with it, I exported the whole thing to substance where I made some changes. Whereas with the other looks the smart material worked well, for this look it just didn't at all. Therefore I deleted some of the height and normal layers and changed some others in values. After doing so I brough it all to Blender where I discovered that the avatar in blender (that I brought as fbx file to CLO to fit the right pose) had different measurements. The rigging of the avatar in CLO changed some of the measurement autonamtically. Therefore I had to re simulate the looks on the correct sized models. After doing that I brought them back to Blender and they finally looked correct.

5. Multifunctional garment
For texturing the multifunctional garment I had some issues. I tried the same steps as with the other looks, but as the tent is designed in Blender, I was not able to texture it in CLO. This is why I had to texture this look partially in Blender only. All the patterns in CLO I brought to substance and then to Blender the same way I did with all the other looks. The tent however got fully textured in Blender. This allowed me to give the pins of the tent and the yarn of the tent a different fabric as I seperated them into different textures. In my opinion it gives an even extra dimension to the texturing.

6. Anonymous 
For the last look I had the most difficulty coming up with it. While having textured all the looks, I found inspiration from Anonymous and wanted to incorporate a screen into the garment. This way the protesters could showscase video material while protesting. The look I textured similar as to the other looks, only the screen I created fully in Substance to create a neat mirror effect: as if the screen was turned off.
