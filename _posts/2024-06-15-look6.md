# The anonymous look

This look is inspired by anonymous. Anonymous is a decentralized hacktivist movement. They often stand at the Dam square of at Central Station holding screens in front of them to tell a message. This makes them very powerfull. I decided to create a top with that screen incorporated, so the wearer would only have to put an I-pad in the pocket to show the story, not hold it anymore. The pants underneath are a variation on the joggings of look 5, but I wanted to give them a more outdoor look, same as the jacket on top. Both pants and jacket have multiple pockets for storache. Furthermore, the jacket has a backpack incorporated on the back of the jacket, so you don't have to bring that with you and take the risk of losing it.
