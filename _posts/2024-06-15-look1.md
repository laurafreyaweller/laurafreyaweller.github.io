This look is inspired on the 1980ies powersuits. The idea of the suit is that when negotaiting with the police, the police will take you more seriously wearing a suit.

* With the files above you can recreate the look that I have made, or create alterations on it. Be aware that:
- For CLO3D and Substance you need a license
- For Blender I have used different add-ons, namely; HumanGenerator, Gscatter, Landscape creator and the regular Blenderkit.
- If you want to open the files in CLO3D, make sure you als have the refered textures, those you can download [here](digital-fabric-recipes)
