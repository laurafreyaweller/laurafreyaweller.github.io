For coloration I wanted a red, blue and yellow color to start with. Working together with the interns from the textile lab, we used wastewater from natural dye experiments to dye the biomaterials with. From the waste water we either used the water directly, we created paste out of the water to add to the biomaterials or we let the ingredients dry and grinded them into pigments. 

One website that really helped me in this process is:
- http://www.paintingplants.nl/verf-maken/

Below you can see a list of all the ingredients and whether they are tested by using wastewater, waste paste or waste pigment.

### General Notes
- Matcha tea gives of a brown color when dry
- Cabbage and Butterfly tea are VERY ph sensitive. Put milligrams of baking soda/vinegar in to play with the ph levels.
