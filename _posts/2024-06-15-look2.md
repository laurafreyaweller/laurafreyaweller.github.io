# The Red Rebel Look

This look is inspired on the red rebels. The red rebels is a group of activist who joing Extinction Rebellion actions often. If you'd like to know more about them, you can find them on [this](https://redrebelbrigade.com/) page. For the red rebel look I wanted to have wide clothing, in which the artists could perform well. I choose the culottes as they reference to the activism of women in the late 19th century. The top is inspired on a high visibility vest, but then made with pockets so it can also function as more storage. The top underneath is just a simple cover for the model.
