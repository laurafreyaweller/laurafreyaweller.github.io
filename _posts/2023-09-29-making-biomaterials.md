To make biomaterials I created an overview of the recipes that I would test. I use 2 bases: Sodium Alginate and CMC+DMC. I combine these bases with paper, orange peel, wool or coffee (or a combination of). Then I test the fabric properties and then I see what I take with me to the next step.

Here you can see the result of the biomaterials
