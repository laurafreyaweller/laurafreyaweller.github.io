The introduction week was set to inspire all students for their concept and visualization. Below you can see the inspiration that I got during this week.

### Inspiration through collaging
First we used collaging and cutting to create a quick line up of looks. This was fun to do, but gave me little inspiration. it does say somehting about the style I am attracted to: bright colors, volumous garments and statement pieces.

### Inspiration through exhibitions
The exhibition I went to was an exhibition on workwear in Het Nieuwe Instituut in Rotterdam. This collection inspired me massively into practical and communal wear for the XR protests.
