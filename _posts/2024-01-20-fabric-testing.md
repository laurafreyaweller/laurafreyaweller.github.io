After making all my materials I decided to digitalize them and test them. 
- To find all the digitalized version of my materials, please look [here](digital-hardware-recipes). 
- To see the outcome of my tests, look below

## Testing outcome

Some of the tests I videotaped. See a compilation of that below:

### Strength test
To test my biomaterial on strength, I used the Titan 5 James Heal machine to do a tenstile strength and elongation test. I used basic calico to compare the results with.

The swatches that I used:

### Seam ripping test
To test the seams on my biomaterial on strength, I used the Titan 5 James Heal machine to do a tenstile strength and elongation test, but now with a sewn swatch. I used basic calico to compare the results with. See the outcome of the results below:

#### Open flat seam
