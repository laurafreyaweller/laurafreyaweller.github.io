# The banner look

This look is inspired on a banner. I thought it would be great if people can wear the banner simutaneously. While the look functions as banner, it is also a poncho for the rain and it can be inflated to become a matrass to stay the night at the blockade.

* With the files above you can recreate the look that I have made, or create alterations on it. Be aware that:
- For CLO3D and Substance you need a license
- For Blender I have used different add-ons, namely; HumanGenerator, Gscatter, Landscape creator and the regular Blenderkit.
- If you want to open the files in CLO3D, make sure you als have the refered textures, those you can download [here](digital-fabric-recipes)
