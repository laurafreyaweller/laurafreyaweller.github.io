In week 10 I had the concept check of my project. Here I tried to showcase my project by presenting the "what, why, how" of my project. Below you can see my presentation:

The feedback I got on this presentation was as follows:

Overall Feedback Research & experimentation - Project definition
- This pitch gave the team a satisfactory impression of the status of your work. Enjoy the rest of the process. However, looking more into biodegradable materials, testing them on values and researching more archetypical garments is missing. We would like to see more of that in de upcoming weeks.
