Besides doing 2 photoshoots I fixed the last little things that still needed doing before the final assessment. FOr example:
- I added the buttons on the physical looks
- I finalized the Vogue magazine
- I made a more classic collection book with all deliverables in it
- I made a summary and video that explains the whole process of this project
- I altered the technical drawings still a littlebit
- I finalized the GitHub page and my documentation
- I made the final presentation
- I made a short jacket for underneath the 2nd physical look

Below you can see the process of some of those things:
