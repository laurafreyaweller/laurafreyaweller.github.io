After finalizing all my looks and preparing them to blender, I worked on my line up and technical drawings. with the line up I took inspiration from the font Extinction Rebellion uses. I used thick outlines to draw the line up. Furthermore I did not add any new garments to the line up, but I played around with the garments in the looks that I already had. I styled them differently or I made them out of different material. For the avatar that I created I was still in my mind with the 6th look that I designed: an anonymous look. Therefore I wanted to not showcase any faces on the looks (also because it does not matter who stands on the protest: XR works because of its collective vision, not it's individual one). I added the stripes purely because of aethetical reasons and the grey "cloud" reffers to an oil smudge - referring back to the fossil fuel industry. You can see the result of that below.

For the technical drawings I used Illustrator to create them.
