In the week before the final assessment I did 2 photoshoots. 1 turned out amazing, the other one a little less amazing. I went with 2 different approaches to the shoot. 
1. Having the photoshoot indoors at De Sering - a place where many XR rebels meet. There are banners with XR texts on them and I thought I could play around with those. 
2. Having a photoshoot outside near Tata Steel in IJmuiden. Here I could show the contrast between nature and industry, pollution and natural beauty, etc.

For the first photoshoot I asked an old friend. He has more experience with portrait pictures, so I assumed inside would be better for him. 
For the second photoshoot I emailed De Fotoacademie for potential fashion photographers and got many replies from people that were interested. The moodboard of that photoshoot you can see below
