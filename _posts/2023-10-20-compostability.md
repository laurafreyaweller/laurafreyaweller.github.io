To check the compostability of the material I did 2 things:
1. I burried samples of the material in the ground. 
2. I created 2 worm hotels and put the materials in there

### 1. Burry the materials
I burried the material samples in the ground for 6 months and then digging it up. Here you can see the process of me burrying the materials:


### 2. Create 2 worm hotels
To check the compostability of the material I created 2 worm hotels. This I did through these websites:
- https://www.asr.nl/blog/diy-wormenhotel-maken
- https://wormenkwekerijwasse.nl/product/compostwormen-mix/?gclid=CjwKCAjwysipBhBXEiwApJOcuzApNDcAYMWMuAgKGoL1XUfY4cP_UrfPN3OiUCcqkMu06qbLAz5zzBoCEnMQAvD_BwE
- https://www.auer-packaging.com/nl/nl/Euroboxen-gesloten/EG-6427-HG.html?color=7001

I added the material onto the worm hotels and let it sit for 2 months, 4 months and 6 months. See below the proces + results.
