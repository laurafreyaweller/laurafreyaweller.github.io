After finishing the coloration research and after putting the right pastes in the big molds, I decided to look at the practical components of the garments. These include shoulderpads,lining, zippers, buttons, hooks, etc. 
Some of these components I am able to 3D print, but some need more research. Therefore I made different foam materials to create shoulderpads. These foam materials come from different recipes from different websites. See the inspiration below:

#### Shoulderpads
After reading recipes I decided to make 4 different recipes in foam:
|Recipes| |
|----------|----------| 
|A| 500 ml water, 100 gr xanthaangom, 16 gr glycerine|
|B| 500 ml water, 100 gr gelatine, 16 gr glycerine, 4 gr sodium alginaat, 8 gr aluin|
|C| 300 ml water, 10 gr MCC, 20 ml CMC, 20 ml glycerine, 3 ml dishwashing liquid, 9 gr paper pulp|
|D| 300 ml water, 15 gr alginate, 10 gr glycerine, 5 gr dishwashing liquid|

The outcomes of these recipes you can see below:

#### Lining
While working with foam, I found that one of the recipes would function beautifully as a lining for the garments. I decided to sew one on a designed fabric to see how the outcome would be. See the result of that below:

#### Zippers
When it comes to zippers it is almost impossible to make them from biodegradable material (you would need a very expensive machine for that) Therefore I have decided not to use any zippers in my physical designs. For my digital designs, I can use zippers. 

#### Buttons
For buttons the 3D printer can print buttons starting from around 3 cm big. Anything smaller should be created in a mold. Making a mold can be done through a vaccuum former. For the buttons of 3cm, see the image below.

#### Hooks
Depending on the hooks that you want to create, a biomaterial printer is able to print them. You need to keep the designs fairly simple. I have tried to print a hook like such below, that worked well.
