When starting with the 3D printing I made 2 pastes that I could work with:
1. Based on Sodium Alginate & paper
2. Based on MCC & paper

The outcome of both prints made me realize that I had to make sure that 
- The printing paste would be thick but very smooth
- the nozzle should be small
- I should print on a surface that holds the paste well: plaster/cast

Here you can see the first print + result:

The result of the 3D print is:

Now I first need to create a good bed for the printing, more nozzle sizes and a good, smooth and thick printing paste before I continue.
