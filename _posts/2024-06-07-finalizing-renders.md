In the week after the red/green check, I looked at the renders that I made so far, and tried to give them just a last little boost. I tried to work with the opacity of the material. This appeared harder then expected. In the 2nd and 4th look you can see a litte opacity now in the renders. See below a before and after of the images:

On top of that I worked with different poses of the models. I wanted to create more fashionable poses, especially with the suit I experimented a lot. I tried out different poses and ended up with the one where the model is laying on the ground. See some experiments that I did with that below.

At last I changed two enviornments, the one of the 4th and 6th look. The environments changed because the previous ones looked a little too fake to me. Also, especially with the 6th look, the environment had glitches when rendering and that made it hard to create a good render. See some of the differences of the environment changes below.
