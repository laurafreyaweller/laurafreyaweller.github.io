Hi all! 

In the second week of my internship I learned to first of all 3D model with a programm called Fusion 360. On top of that I 3D printen my own created model and I learned how to clean and use the lasercutter. Below I will first dive into the basics of Fusion 360 and my first 3D printed model. After this, I will explain more about the lasercutter.

Adobe here you see the starting environment of the programm Fusion 360. Before starting with Fusion 360 I had some experience in 3D modeling. Programms I used before were CLO3D, the Adobe substance 3D programms and Blender. As I see it now, CLO3D is a 3D programm that can be used for creating garments, the Adobe substance 3D programms are great for changing or creating texture of objects. Blender is a programm that can be used for animation, video creation, games and image simulations needed for animation. Fusion is a great tool for mechanical drawings and designs. Learning to work with fusion I see as an additional skill that can help me in the end with my digital designs. 

Below here I wrote down some basic shortcuts that helped me started. I also pasted the link of the youtube tutorials that helped me get started in Fusion 360.

shortcuts:

S = Sketch Toolbox

Q = Duwen (push) / trekken (pull)

C = Cirkel

D = Dimensie

L = Lijn

X = Constructie

P = Project

Ctrl + Z = Ongedaan maken

J = Scharnier (Joint)

After some puzzeling and playing around with the programm I managed to design a little cutlery cup where I can put my cutlery in after washing them (I have been waiting for the right time to get one - and I thought this would be a nice challenge). You can see below in the image the process of the 3D design in Fusion 360 and the 3D design in the programm UltiMaker Cura - which is a software that can help you 3D print your designed object.

After 3D modeling through Fusion 360 I decided to start with printing my 3D model on a 3D printer.

> *3D printing the model*

At De Waag there are several 3D printers to print with. See [here](http://make.waaglabs.nl/fablab/docs/machines/3D%20printers/) the printers De Waag offers. I have used for my first test the printer Creality Ender 3. You can also use the Prusa i3 MK3S or Ultimaker. 

To start with a 3D print, you have to upload your exported .stl file from Fusio 360 into UltiMaker Cura (another programm). In this programm you can choose the printer you are printing with, upload your .stl and slice it so it prepared for the 3D printer to "read". Now you can save your "sliced" file on a SD card to upload on the printer (it will now be saved as a .gcode file). For the Creality Ender 3, your settings can be as follows: your material is PLA and your nozzle size is 1 mm.
