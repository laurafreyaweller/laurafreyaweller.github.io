Welcome to my documentation page. In this page you will see the documentation of both my internship and graduation project. 

## How is this page set up?
I will briefly explain how the page is set up. Each week contains a color, matching the thing that I have worked on the most at that time. 
- Blue = researching the concept, the biomaterials, the digitalization of the materials, etc. 
- Green = making the garments, the materials, the molds, etc. 
- Orange = learning about the machines, the materials, etc. 

Furthermore you can see which week I'm at at the left bottom of the pictures. At the right you can see which internship SMART goal I am working on. And in the middle you can see what I sepcifically was working on that week. When you click on the image you get redirected to the page that shows the process and insights of that week.
