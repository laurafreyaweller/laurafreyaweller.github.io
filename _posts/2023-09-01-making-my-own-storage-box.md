To make my own storage ox I started out with watching some Youtube tutorials on how to work in Fusion 360. Some links that were helpful are:

### Modeling in Fusion
After watching some tutorials, I decided to design my own box. I started by measuring the wood that was available. I measured the thickness, length and width of the wood. See below my measurements for the box:
- 30 x 30 x 40
- This means 2x a wooden plate of 30 x 30; 3x a wooden plate of 30 x 45
- The wood that I could find had different sizes in thickness, so I had to calculate that into the design. This means:
> - 30 x 30 (11.8 mm thick) 1x
> - 30 x 30 (12,4 mm thick) 1x
> - 30 x 40 (12,4 mm thick) 1x
> - 30 x 40 (12,2 mm thick) 2x

After having set the thickness of the wood, hight, length and depth of the storage box, I decided to create parameters in Fusion 360. The parameters that I used were: height: 300mm, depth: 300mm, length 450mm, thicknessA 11,8mm, thicknessB 12,2mm, thicknessC 12,4mm. While following the tutorial steps (with some practise) I created the box in Fusion in around 2,5 hours.

After you have created the model in Fusion, you need to prepare it for the Shopbot. This you do by created a gcoded file for the shopbot. To do this in Fusion I again watched some lovely tutorials (all of them mentioned on the top of this page).
