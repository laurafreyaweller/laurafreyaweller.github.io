On this page you can find a summary of my whole process. I've taken the time to make a visual overview of a timeline and video that explains that timeline a bit more in detail. The video takes 12,5 minutes to watch. The video is splitted in 3 parts:
- Explanation of the website: 00.00 - 03.23
- Explanation of the first semester of the project (first 20 weeks): 03.23 - 08.40
- Explanation of the second semester of the project (last 20 weeks): 08.40 - 12.31

I hope that after watching the video, you understand the set up of this whole website and how to navigate through as well as the core of my process. Have fun watching!

If you only want to see the timeline in a quick overview, then watch below. The start of the timeline is on the bottom. It might take a bit of time for the image to load as it is big.
