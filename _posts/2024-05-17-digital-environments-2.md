After the interim check I dived further into digital environments. I discussed my ideas that I had with Charlotte and after some thorough consideration I decided to leave my digital environment idea behind and create a new one. As mentioned, I received feedback during the interim check that the product is not fashionable enough and that I should look more into the finishings and details to create that. Charlotte also mentioned that I could create Vogue covers as a way to showcase how my looks actually fit the fashion look. I am not enthousiastic about this idea at all, but she has a fair point. This is why I decided to create a small Vogue sample to show how my biodegradable materials can still have the fashionable luxury that the fashion industry wants. I looked up different Vogue magazines, compared them and made a rough set up of how many issues are set up. I designed a smaller (30 paged) version for myself and tried to keep the layout of the actual Vogue as much in place as possible. The articles are replaced by article topics that I think should be in Vogue, but also my concept text, research paper, Vogue articles on Extinction Rebellion, etc. In the edition is also the digital and physical photoshoot. Below in the video you can see a small set up of the Vogue edition.

This I discussed with Suza, she gave me more great insights. To get to this Vogue magazine I could use the human generator add on and rokoko plus in for poses to get a more realistic human for the renders. I could use environments from PolyHaven and then a plug in (from an old blender version) to create a ground. 

After pitching this idea to Niall he took it further and asked me if I could still give it some white lookbook background, like you see on [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MFDz6QSWvE&ab_channel=DigitalFashionBlender). Now I'm using this idea to render my videos.

After pitching all of this to Charlotte I really got convinced in the idea. She made me see that the only thing I try to do is bring the fashion world and a sustainable world together. Sustainability in the materials of the collection and the way of designing the looks, but visualizing it in a fashion industry language: the Vogue. This way you can see the visualisation of the collection as a symbolic step in which I try to visualise how it would look to bring these two worlds together and make each other stronger. 

So I decided to create different digital environments to create renders for my Vogue magazine. After creating my 6 environments I made some quick renders and added them into the Vogue magazine to give a first impression of my idea. I still want to fine tune some of the renders and I want to wait for the final physical photoshoot (which will take place on the 10th and 12th of June) to really have my Vogue magazine finished. The result of what I have now you can see below.
