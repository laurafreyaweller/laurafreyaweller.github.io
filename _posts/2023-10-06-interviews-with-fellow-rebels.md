For de 9th week van dit project ben ik in diepteinterviews gedoken waarin ik heb geprobeerd de behoeftes van rebellen tijdens een XR protest in kaart te brengen. Dit heb ik gedaan door de volgende vragen te stellen.

> 1. How long have you been an XR member?

> 2. How often have you participated in actions?

> 3. What were your reasons to join XR?

> 4. Can you tell me in your own words how a day of a blockade passes by?

> 5. How do you prepare yourself beforehand?

> 6. Are there specific things you pack beforehand?

> 7. Why do you pack these things?

> 8. How do you dress beforehand? 

> 9. Why do you dress like that?

> 10. Do you sometimes miss functionality in the clothing that you wear? 

> 11. What did you bring with you today and why?

> 12. Is there anything else that we missed that you would still like to share with me? 

I need to keep the interviewers anonymous. Therefore I will not record any of the interviews of their specific answers. What I will do is make an overview of the most interesting answers I got back on each question
