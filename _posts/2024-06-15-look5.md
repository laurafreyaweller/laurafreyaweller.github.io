# The multifunctional look

This look is inspired on graig green. His collections for Moncler have always touched the multipfunctionality of the garment. He tried to incorporate several outdoor elements, such as matrasses, kytes, tents and boat gear into the garments. While being on the protest, you might have to stay overnight, so I wanted to incorporate a tent in the look. The top that you see here is a reference to the role of shirt and prints in activism, the wearer is wearing a mouth mask to stay anonymous and the pants are more joggings inspired, something to give comfort, especially if you stay the night. Still the joggings have elements of protective kneecaps and buttcaps to help the activist.
