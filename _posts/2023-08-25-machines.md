Hi all! 

In the second and third week of my internship I learned to work with all the machines of the FabLab. See below all the machines. When you click on them, you get directed to the how-to-use page. See here the link to the documentation of De Waag. It really helped me get started: [Documentation De Waag](http://make.waaglabs.nl/fablab/docs/machines/).

The machines that you can work with, you can see here below:
